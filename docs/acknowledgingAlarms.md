### Acknowledging Alarms 
Alarm Definitions allow for a user to indicate that an alarm requires Acknowledgement. This requires a user 
within the system to open the alarm, make comments on the alarm and then close out the alarm to clear it 
from the system. The configuration of an alarm requiring acknowledgement can be found in the Alarm 
Definition section. 

To open an alarm, double-click on the alarm from the live 
monitor or event history. This will open up a window on the 
right-hand side of the windows client. This window will include 
the event, the ID photo of the associated cardholder (if 
applicable), instructions as written for the alarm, and pre-defined acknowledgement comments, and previous comments 
along with a time stamp.

Within the alarm acknowledgement view, a comment of 
“Alarm Viewed” will automatically be added to the alarm 
every time it is opened. The username of the individual who 
opened the alarm will also show along with the time stamp. 
These notes are not editable. 

To close the alarm, an alarm acknowledgement comment 
must be added and the “Close Alarm” check box must be 
checked. Then click “Save” or “Save & Close” to close the 
alarm. 

The attach image button will allow for images to be added to 
the alarm comments for later review. This can be a still taken 
from a video or a picture taken by an operator while 
investigating the event.
