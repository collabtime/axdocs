### Using People Lists:
The People List is used to quickly and easily see all the people in the system’s database. The People List will 
include card holders, visitors, operators or anyone else that has been added to the system.

* Add Person – from the People List, an operator can add a person as out lined in the previous section.
* Grid Layout – allows an operator to save customized views of the People List.
* View Expiring Cards – provides a simple and quick way to view all cards expiring by a selected date.
This also allows the operator to extend out all or some of those cards set to expire. 
* Search Bar – Provides text-based searching of all persons in the database. 
* “+” – provides access to additional information about people.

Through Custom Data, Access Expert can capture additional 
information about each individual person. To maximize screen 
space, much of this information is hidden until the “+” button is 
selected on the left side of the screen. Selecting the “+” button 
will open the filtered window showing the additional information 
that is available for that person. By selecting the blue “+/-“, the 
operator can add the hidden information to the main screen as a 
vertical column. Once added as a column the information can then be filtered on and searched on.

It is important to note that the Search bar will only query the name data on a person. To query the other fields 
on a person, use the Global Search feature.

When searching within a grid view of the People List, 
hovering over a column header will show a key icon 
in orange. Clicking on that icon will allow you to 
choose from the option of the column. This allows for 
filter on a singular object in a different manner. When 
this is done, a filter editor at the bottom of the page 
will show. Clicking on the pencil icon will allow editing 
of that filter editor using more complex and/or logic 
within the page.

Clicking on View Expiring Cards will launch a new page with all card expiring between the current date and a 
settable later date. The later date will default to one (1) month from the current time.
