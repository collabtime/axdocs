### Elevator Access Levels

Elevator Access Levels use the same Schedules as other aspects of the Access Expert system. The Elevator 
Access Levels are used to determine when a 
person can access certain floors. Floors can
be assigned scheduled access within the
Elevator Access Level to determine what 
floors a person has permissions to gain 
access to. Floors can be added by individual 
number or by a span of numbers with a “-“ 
between them.

It is important to note that People are not added to the Elevator Access Level. People are added to the 
Access Level for either traditional reader-controlled points such as doors or gates or a reader controlling 
elevator access. This approach means that management of where and when a person can gain access can all 
be controlled from one page.

To create a new Elevator Access Level:

1. Select the ‘Access Configuration’ Tab.
2. Choose “Elevator Access” From the Menu.
3. Click the “Add Elevator Access Level” button.
4. Enter a Display Name.
5. (OPTIONAL) Add Default Reader Mapping.
6. Select “Add Elevator Floor Entry”.
7. Select a Schedule.
8. Enter the desired Floor Number(s).
9. Click “Save” or “Save & Close”.

The Default Reader Mapping will apply the floor names assigned at the Reader Page to all readers that use the 
Elevator Access Level. This also allows for the selection of floors for the Elevator Access Level based on the 
named floors.

To Assign an Elevator Access Level:

1. Select the ‘Access Configuration’ Tab.
2. Select “Access Levels” From the Menu.
3. Open the desired Access Level.
4. Select “View Elevator Access” at the bottom of 
the Access Level Entry section.
5. Click “Add Elevator Access Level Entry”.
6. Choose an Elevator Access Level & associated 
Elevator Reader.
7. Click “Save” or “Save & Close”.

It is important to note the flow of the different type of Access Levels:

1. Elevator Access Levels are applied to Access Levels.
2. Access Levels are applied to People.
