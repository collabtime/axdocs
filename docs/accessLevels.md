### Access Levels

People, Schedules, and Readers/Doors can be linked together using Access Levels to ensure appropriate access
decisions are made at the door (granted or denied). Readers and people can exist in multiple Access Levels at 
the same time and access rights can be predetermined by associating an Access Level with a Badge Type.

It is not necessary to manually add People to an Access Level from the Access Level page; Access Levels can be 
applied when the Cardholder record is created. If desired, it is also possible to open the People List next to the 
Access Level, select multiple persons then drag them to the Assigned Person screen. The Access Level page
provides a simple way to easily see who has the access, through what doors and during what times. An Access 
Level can also be configured to require an Escort for those people using the Access Level. The Escort options 
are:
1. None
2. Approved Escort
3. Escort Required
4. 
Note: If an access level requires escort, an appropriate access level of approved escorts must also be 
created.

Adding an Access Level:

1. Select the ‘Access
Configuration’ Tab.
2. Choose “Access Levels” 
from the Menu.
3. Click the “Add Access
Level” button.
4. Enter a Display Name.
5. Assign People as
required.
6. (OPTIONAL) Set a Start
and End Date.
7. (OPTIONAL) Set is Global
8. Add Access Level Entry to specify Reader(s) and associated Schedule(s).
9. Click “Save” or “Save & Close”.

Access Level Start Dates are used when an access level should start to provide access at a time in the future,
but the card holders badge should be active before that time. The access Level End Date is used when an 
access level should no longer provide access at a specific date and time, but the card holders badge should 
continue to be active. An example of this is for access to a construction zone or terminating student access to 
dorms at the end of the year. ***Note: The End date is limited to 5 years in the future.

A Global Access Level is an access level that can be assigned and seen in a shared instance when the Access 
Level resides in the Enterprise Instance.

***NOTE: If an Access Level has a schedule with a holiday, the cardholders in that Access Level will not have 
access when that Holiday is active.

Access Levels are also used to manage Elevator Controls for times of day for access. An Elevator Access Level 
can be added by clicking the View Elevator Access option and then clicking the add button then choosing the 
reader(s) configured to be used for Elevators and applying the Elevator Access Level required.
