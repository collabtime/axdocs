### Batch People Creation and Import
CSV importing can be utilized to quickly populate the system database. The CSV template file is
included and can be downloaded by selecting the “Download Example CSV” button. Once
populated the file is then saved locally on the customers machine and then uploaded into Access 
Expert by clicking the “Upload CSV” button.

To Import from a Batch File:

1. Complete the CSV file and 
save local to the workstation.
2. Select the “Upload CSV”
button.
3. Navigate to the file location.
4. Select “OK”.
5. Click “Save”.

Once the file has been imported, the operator will be able to review and modify the information prior to 
clicking the Save button. No information is added to the system until the Save button is selected.

To see more column options, click the “Column Chooser” button. Check the boxes next to the columns you 
want to show. Once complete, you can click the “Download Current Layout Example” to download a CSV file 
with the columns shown in the window.

***Note: The column headers can be added and removed but the name cannot be edited within the csv. The 
name displayed in the csv is the name being searched for by the Windows Client and modification may result in 
errors. If a column is not needed, simply do not populate any data.

Access Levels: 

Multiple access levels can be added by separating each one with a “;”. Example “Access Level 1; Access Level 2; 
Access Level 3”.
