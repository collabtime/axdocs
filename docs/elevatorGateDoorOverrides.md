### Readers

The "Readers" section is mainly used to pulse a reader to provide access but can also be used to "Unlock", "Lock Down" and "Reset" the readers.
To bring up the options, right-click on the circle icon and select an option.

### Gates

The "Gates" section allows for the opening and closing of the gates. To open or close a gate, right-click on the appropriate icon and click "Activate Procedure."

NOTE: Selecting "Deactivate Procedure" will not produce the opposite command. For example, if the gate is open and the "Deactivate Procedure" is selected on the "OPEN"
icon, the gate will not close. In this case,  the "Activate Procedure" would need to be selected on the "CLOSE" icon.
